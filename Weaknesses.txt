Note: Did not implement a distributed database for storing items. since all instances use their own memory to store items, we don't expect duplicate checks to work properly in this solution.

Weaknesses in the Solution:

1. Lack of Error Handling in DistributedSemaphore

2. Hardcoded Lock Expiry Time

3. Lack of Logging

4. No Handling of Redis Connection Failures

5. Inefficient Duplicate Checking:
   - Duplicate checking in SaveItem may be inefficient for a large number of items. Optimize the logic or use unique constraints in the storage mechanism.

6. Hardcoded Connection String:
   - The connection string to Redis is hardcoded, and in a real-world scenario, it should be externalized and configurable.

7. Limited Scalability Considerations:
    - The solution may not scale well in highly concurrent and distributed environments.
